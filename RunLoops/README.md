## What is "Run Loops"
>Run loops are part of the fundamental infrastructure associated with threads. A run loop is an event processing loop that you use to schedule work and coordinate the receipt of incoming events. The purpose of a run loop is to keep your thread busy when there is work to do and put your thread to sleep when there is none.

>Run loop management is not entirely automatic. You must still design your thread’s code to start the run loop at appropriate times and respond to incoming events. Both Cocoa and Core Foundation provide run loop objects to help you configure and manage your thread’s run loop. Your application does not need to create these objects explicitly; each thread, including the application’s main thread, has an associated run loop object. Only secondary threads need to run their run loop explicitly, however. The app frameworks automatically set up and run the run loop on the main thread as part of the application startup process.

From what I understand 
- Run Loop could ensure the events passed into threads could be proceed.
- Unless it's a secondary thread, every threads will manage a run loop for themselves automatically.
